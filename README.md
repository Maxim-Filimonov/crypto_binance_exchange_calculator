# Purpose
Living in sanctioned country as foreign resident is not fun. As I cannot access any of my country banks I needed to find a way around. However, it was taking too time and effort to calculate what is the best currency to use for exchange.
So this is hacked together in one sleepless night - that's why it's hardcoded to AUD -> RUB only cause that's my case :D
UI has no styles at all I literally wanted something which is quick and realtime. Why NUXT - cause I wanted to try it.
